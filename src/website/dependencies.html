<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>
  At this time Cyclops Core has no external dependencies. Internally any
  dependencies are bundled and encapsulated with the Cyclops script.
  These dependencies are not public and are simply and internal
  implementation detail. If Cyclops Core is consumed and no other framework
  library is included our widgets will be registered with the global
  version on jQuery, if and when included, to allow consumption of our
  components without a framework.
