<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>
  Cyclops Core has very few external dependencies in order to be as flexible as possible.
  Currently the only external dependency is on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. A
  consuming application may choose not to use jQuery but it is required for the internals of
  Cyclops Core. Our custom controls are exposed through the use of jQuery Widgets allowing
  Cyclops Core to embellish and extend standard HTML markup providing a richer user experience.
  However, if you would a more native consumption model please refer to one of the Cyclops
  Projectâ€™s framework specific packages.
