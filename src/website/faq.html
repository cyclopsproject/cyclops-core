        <h4>What is Cyclops?</h4>
        <p>
          Cyclops is the CenturyLink Cloud's collection of user interface patterns that make up the
          Control Portal interface. For more information please see the
          <a href="about.html">about</a> page for a full explanation.

        <h4>What is Cyclops Core?</h4>
        <p>
          Cyclops Core is part of the Cyclops Project, a collection of Cyclops related libraries.
          During development of v2.0.0 it was decided to create a core library (Cyclops Core) with
          as few external dependencies as possible and move framework specific components into
          framework libraries (Cyclops Anglugar2, Cyclops Knockout, etc.)
        </p>

      <section id="WhereToGetCyclops" class="qa">
        <h4>Where can I get it?</h4>
        <p>
          There is a CDN version of Cyclops Core that is hosted on
          <a href="assets.ctl.io">assets.ctl.io</a>. This provides built in caching and
          performance benefits. However, if an application already has a built in bundling
          and minification then a local copy may be reference either by downloading the file
          from the assets server or installing it via NPM.

      <section id="browserSupport" class="qa">
        <h4>What browsers does it support?</h4>
        <p>
        Cyclops supports the latest versions of all major browsers. Specifically for Internet
        Explorer, IE9 + is supported with IE9 having fall back behaviors and some more advanced
        features may not work.
        </p>

      <section id="versions" class="qa">
        <h4>How can I get notified about new versions / features?</h4>
        <p>
        All publically available version of Cyclops can be found on the
        <a href="assets.ctl.io">assets.ctl.io</a> website and as tags on the github repository.
        This includes both stable and prerelease versions, which can be identified using the
        <a href="symver.org">semantic versioning syntax</a>. As a general rule of thumb new stable
        versions will be called out in our slack channel as well. If you have a feature request
        please open and issue on the Cyclops github repository.
